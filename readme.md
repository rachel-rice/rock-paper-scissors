# Rock Paper Scissors (Console Version)

This project is an early JavaScript exercise focused on conditional logic, functions, and basic program flow.

The game runs in the browser console and plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors between a fixed player choice and a randomly generated computer choice. The outcome is logged to the console.

This project does not include a user interface, as it was an early learning project.
